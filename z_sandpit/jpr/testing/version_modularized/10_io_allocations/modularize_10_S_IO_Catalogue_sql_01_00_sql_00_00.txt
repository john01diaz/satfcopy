You are a Spark SQL expert. Decompose the provided SQL script into self-contained sub-scripts. Improve the modularity and readability of the code.

Each sub-script should contain at most one "JOIN" operation.
Identify and isolate any common table expressions (CTEs) within the code.
Separate any renaming of columns within "SELECT" statements (e.g., "SELECT XXX AS YYY").

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW VW_IOCard_Prep_Query
As
    Select Distinct
     A.database_name
    ,A.dynamic_class
    ,A.object_identifier
    ,B.ModelNo as Model_Number
    ,CONCAT(Count(ChannelNumber) Over(Partition by A.Database_name,IOType,A.Item_Object_Identifier)
            ,' - Channel -',Description) as Description
    ,MAX(Manufacturer) Over(Partition by B.ModelNo) as Manufacturer
    ,ChannelNumber
    ,IOType	
    ,A.Class
     --,Tag_Number
    --,Loop_Number
    --,Document_Number
    ,Count(ChannelNumber) Over(Partition by A.Database_name,IOType,A.Item_Object_Identifier) as NoOfPoints
    from Sigraph_silver.S_Itemfunction A
    Inner join Sigraph_silver.S_Item_Function_Model B
    On A.database_name=B.database_name
    and A.Item_Dynamic_Class=B.Item_Dynamic_Class
    and A.Item_Object_identifier=B.Item_Object_identifier
    and A.Dynamic_Class=B.Dynamic_Class
    and A.Object_Identifier=B.Object_Identifier
    Where Type='IO Module' 
    and ChannelNumber is not null 
    and ChannelNumber<>'0'
    and ChannelNumber<>''

he first step is to isolate each operation from the main script. This operation will increase the modularity and readability of the SQL code.

First, let's decompose the JOIN operation into its own script.
Then, isolate the DISTINCT operation.
Separate the renaming operations into different SELECT statements.
Lastly, the window functions and aggregate functions used need to be in their separate scripts as well.
Here's how the decomposed SQL script would look like:

Script 1: Join Operation

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW VW_IOCard_Pre_Join AS
SELECT
    A.database_name,
    A.dynamic_class,
    A.object_identifier,
    B.ModelNo,
    B.Manufacturer,
    A.IOType,
    A.Class,
    A.ChannelNumber
FROM
    Sigraph_silver.S_Itemfunction A
INNER JOIN
    Sigraph_silver.S_Item_Function_Model B
ON
    A.database_name=B.database_name AND
    A.Item_Dynamic_Class=B.Item_Dynamic_Class AND
    A.Item_Object_identifier=B.Item_Object_identifier AND
    A.Dynamic_Class=B.Dynamic_Class AND
    A.Object_Identifier=B.Object_Identifier
WHERE
    B.Type='IO Module' AND
    A.ChannelNumber IS NOT NULL AND
    A.ChannelNumber <> '0' AND
    A.ChannelNumber <> '';
Script 2: Distinct Operation

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW VW_IOCard_Distinct AS
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM VW_IOCard_Pre_Join;
Script 3: Window Function

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW VW_IOCard_Window AS
SELECT
    database_name,
    dynamic_class,
    object_identifier,
    ModelNo,
    CONCAT(COUNT(ChannelNumber) OVER (PARTITION BY database_name, IOType, object_identifier), ' - Channel -', Manufacturer) AS Description,
    MAX(Manufacturer) OVER (PARTITION BY ModelNo) as Manufacturer_Max,
    ChannelNumber,
    IOType,
    Class,
    COUNT(ChannelNumber) OVER (PARTITION BY database_name, IOType, object_identifier) as NoOfPoints
FROM
    VW_IOCard_Distinct;
Script 4: Final Script with Column Renaming

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW VW_IOCard_Prep_Query AS
SELECT
    database_name,
    dynamic_class,
    object_identifier,
    ModelNo AS Model_Number,
    Description,
    Manufacturer_Max AS Manufacturer,
    ChannelNumber,
    IOType,
    Class,
    NoOfPoints
FROM
    VW_IOCard_Window;
This final script renames the columns and uses the results from the previous scripts. The operations are separated into their own scripts, and each script is dependent on the previous script's output. This makes the entire process more modular and easier to understand.
