You are a Spark SQL expert. Decompose the provided SQL script into self-contained sub-scripts. Improve the modularity and readability of the code.

Each sub-script should contain at most one "JOIN" operation.
Identify and isolate any common table expressions (CTEs) within the code.
Separate any renaming of columns within "SELECT" statements (e.g., "SELECT XXX AS YYY").

Script 4: Final View Creation

This script uses the output of the joined view and performs column renaming and default value assignments. It also ensures ordering of data.
