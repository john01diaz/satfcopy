Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the Python Enum for the column names:

python
Copy code
from enum import Enum

class IO_Catalogue(Enum):
    ALLOWUSE = 'allowuse'
    CHANNEL = 'channel'
    DESCRIPTION = 'description'
    DESCRIPTIONDRAWING = 'descriptiondrawing'
    IOTYPE = 'iotype'
    MANUFACTURER = 'manufacturer'
    MODEL_NUMBER = 'model_number'
    NOOFPOINTS = 'noofpoints'
    TERMINALSPERMARKING = 'terminalspermarking'
    TERMINALSPERPOINTCHANNEL = 'terminalsperpointchannel'
This Python Enum, named 'Instrument_Index', has capitalized names as you requested and the values are in lowercase. To access the values of this Enum you would do something like Instrument_Index.ALLOWUSE.value. This would give you the string 'allowuse'.
