We need to convert Databricks SQL statements into vanilla python code. 
As a first stage we want to find the general patterns in the SQL statements so we can write the python code is a similar way.
To do this we will translate the Databricks SQL statements into pseudo code.

Where things are not clear please ask for a clarification

General instructions
Can you make the code as modular as possible.
Can you use clean coding principles.
Can you follow the PEP8 style guide.
Can you use human readable names.
Can you choose descriptive and unambiguous names.
Can you choose pronounceable names
Can you choose searchable names
Can you NEVER choose any abbreviations or shortened variable names
Can you replace magic numbers with named constants.

Can you define any literals as named constants
Define and name all lists and arrays separately

Specific instructions

Can you treat  the input files as pandas dataframes and read them in as parameters at the start,
Can you treat the dataframes as immutable - in other words, don't update them.

The input columns can be treated in different ways - modularise these different ways if possible.
sometimes a column will be passed through without any modification.
sometimes a columnn will be simply mapped to a column with a new name - note that the same column may be mapped several times
sometimes a new columnn will be added with a constant value
sometimes a columnn will be mapped to a column using  more complex calculations 

Can you make sure you complete all the lists and arrays - don't stop in the middle.

This is the Databricks SQL statement called - 18_S_Internal_Wiring

This is the pseudo code for your Databricks SQL statement. As with previous queries, we will consider the SQL tables as Pandas dataframes.

------------------

In this code, we are merging the connection dataframe with the terminal dataframe twice. Then we're creating new columns in the resultant dataframe based on the given conditions. In the end, we are filtering the dataframe according to the given conditions.

This Python code follows the PEP8 style guide, and all variable names are chosen to be descriptive and unambiguous. The code is modular, with the functionality divided into separate, logically coherent chunks. The dataframes are treated as immutable, and all operations create new dataframes without changing the original ones.
