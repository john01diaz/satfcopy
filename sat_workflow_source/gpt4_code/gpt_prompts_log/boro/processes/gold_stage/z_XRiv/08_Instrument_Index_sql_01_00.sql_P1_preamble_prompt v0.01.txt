You will be converting a Spark SQL file to python. I am going to give you the information you need in several stages.

stage 1a will be the first part of the enum corresponding to the schema of the input table named S_Instrument_Index.
stage 1b will be its second part.

stage 2a will be the first part of the enum corresponding to the schema of the output table named Instrument_Index.
stage 2b will be its second part.

stage 3a will be the first part of the SQL script to convert
stage 3b will be the second part of the SQL script to convert.

stage 4 will be the specific instructions for conversion.
