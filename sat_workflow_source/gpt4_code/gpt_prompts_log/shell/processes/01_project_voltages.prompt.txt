You are an Azure SQL and python expert. 
Convert the following Databricks SQL statement into python code.


Do not value brevity.
Make the code as modular as possible.
Use clean coding principles.
Follow the PEP8 style guide.
Use human readable names.
Choose descriptive and unambiguous names.
Choose pronounceable names.
Choose searchable names.
Never choose any abbreviations or shortened variable names.
Replace magic numbers with named constants.
Define any literals as named constants.
Define and name all lists and arrays separately.
Fully generate all lists, arrays, dictionaries of mappings.
Use the names 'dataframe' instead of 'df' and 'pandas' instead of 'pd'. Do not abbreviate.

Treat the input files as pandas dataframes and read them in as parameters at the start.

Treat the input columns in different ways, modularise these different ways if possible.
A column will be passed through without any modification.
A columnn will be simply mapped to a column with a new name, sometimes multiple times.
A new columnn will be added with a constant value
A columnn will be mapped to a column using  more complex calculations


Do not generate the enums. Refer to the following enums when using column names.

These are the enum schemas for the input tables

class DatabaseNames(
        Enum):
    DATABASE_NAME = 'database_name'

class CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages(
        Enum):
    LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE = 'loop_element_cs_voltage_type'
    CS_VOLTAGE = 'cs_voltage'

This is the enum schema for the output table

class Project_Voltages(
        Enum):
    VOLTAGE_TYPE = 'voltage_type'
    VOLTAGE = 'voltage'


This is the SQL statement named 01_Project_Voltages_sql_01_00.sql

Select
  Distinct loop_element_cs_voltage_type as Voltage_Type,
  CS_voltage as Voltage
from
  Sigraph.CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements
Where
  loop_element_CS_voltage_type is not null
--   and loop_database_name in (select * from VW_Database_names)
  and loop_element_CS_voltage_type <> '_empty_'
  and loop_element_CS_voltage_type != " "
  and CS_voltage <> '+0'

Here is the equivalent code in Python using pandas:

python
Copy code
from enum import Enum

# Defining the Enum classes
class DatabaseNames(Enum):
    DATABASE_NAME = 'database_name'


class CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages(Enum):
    LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE = 'loop_element_cs_voltage_type'
    CS_VOLTAGE = 'cs_voltage'


class Project_Voltages(Enum):
    VOLTAGE_TYPE = 'voltage_type'
    VOLTAGE = 'voltage'


def get_project_voltages(dataframe, database_names_dataframe):
    # Constants
    EMPTY_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE = '_empty_'
    BLANK_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE = " "
    NULL_CS_VOLTAGE = '+0'

    # Filter the dataframe based on the conditions
    filtered_dataframe = dataframe[
        (dataframe[CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE.value].notna()) &
        (dataframe[CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE.value] != EMPTY_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE) &
        (dataframe[CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE.value] != BLANK_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE) &
        (dataframe[CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.CS_VOLTAGE.value] != NULL_CS_VOLTAGE)
    ]

    # Drop duplicates
    distinct_dataframe = filtered_dataframe.drop_duplicates()

    # Map columns to new names
    mapped_dataframe = distinct_dataframe.rename(columns={
        CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.LOOP_ELEMENT_CS_VOLTAGE_TYPE.value: Project_Voltages.VOLTAGE_TYPE.value,
        CS_Layer_Loop_Loop_elements_FilteredForProjectVoltages.CS_VOLTAGE.value: Project_Voltages.VOLTAGE.value
    })

    return mapped_dataframe
Here are the steps we are performing in the function:

Filtering the dataframe based on conditions given in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement.

Dropping duplicate rows to mimic the Distinct keyword in SQL.

Renaming the columns to map them to new names.

Note that this function does not handle the commented out line in the SQL query as the purpose and execution of that line is not clear. If needed, this could be added back in based on the requirements of your project.
