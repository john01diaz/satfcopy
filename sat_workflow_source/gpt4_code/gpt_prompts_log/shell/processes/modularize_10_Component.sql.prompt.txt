You are a Azure SQL expert.
Decompose the provided SQL script into self-contained sub-scripts.
Improve the modularity and readability of the code.

Each sub-script should contain at most one "JOIN" operation.
Identify and isolate any common table expressions (CTEs) within the code.
Separate any renaming of columns within "SELECT" statements (e.g., "SELECT XXX AS YYY").

Input:

Select 
A.Parent_Equipment_No
,A.Equipment_No
,A.EquipmentType
,A.CatalogueNo
,A.DinRail
,Row_Number() Over(Partition by Parent_Equipment_No,DinRail order by Item_Object_identifier) as Sequence
,Remarks  
From (
Select Distinct
A.Parent_Equipment_No
,A.Equipment_No
,A.EquipmentType
,A.CatalogueNo
,A.DinRail
,A.Remarks  
,A.Item_Object_identifier
From Sigraph_Silver.S_Component A
Where A.Class in ('Instrumentation','Inst(Shared)','Elec(Shared)') and database_name in (Select Database_name from VW_Database_names) 
) as A

Output:

-- Sub-script 1: Get database names
SELECT Database_name 
FROM VW_Database_names;

-- Sub-script 2: Filter the S_Component table
SELECT DISTINCT
    Parent_Equipment_No,
    Equipment_No,
    EquipmentType,
    CatalogueNo,
    DinRail,
    Remarks,
    Item_Object_identifier
FROM Sigraph_Silver.S_Component 
WHERE Class IN ('Instrumentation','Inst(Shared)','Elec(Shared)') 
    AND database_name IN (SELECT Database_name FROM DatabaseNames);

-- Sub-script 3: Calculate sequence numbers
SELECT 
    Parent_Equipment_No,
    Equipment_No,
    EquipmentType,
    CatalogueNo,
    DinRail,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Parent_Equipment_No, DinRail ORDER BY Item_Object_identifier) AS Sequence,
    Remarks  
FROM FilteredComponents;
