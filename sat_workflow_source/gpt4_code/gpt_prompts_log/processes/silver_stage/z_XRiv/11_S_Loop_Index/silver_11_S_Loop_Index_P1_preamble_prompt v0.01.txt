You will be converting a Spark SQL file to python. I am going to give you the information you need in several stages.

stage 1 will be several enums corresponding to the schemas of the input tables named layer, loop and PBS_Table (code to be provided later).

stage 2 will be an enum corresponding to the schema of the output table named S_Loop_Index (code to be provided later).

stage 3 will contain the SQL script along with specific instructions for conversion.
