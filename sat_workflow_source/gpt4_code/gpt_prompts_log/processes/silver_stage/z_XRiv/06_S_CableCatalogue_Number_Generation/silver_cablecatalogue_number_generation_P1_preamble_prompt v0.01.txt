You will be converting a Spark SQL file to python. I am going to give you the information you need in several stages.

 

stage 1 will be several enum corresponding to the schemas of the input tables named S_CableCoreCatalogue and S_CableCatalogue (code to be provided later).

 

stage 2 will be an enum corresponding to the schema of the output table named S_CableCatalogueNumber_Master (code to be provided later).

 

stage 3 will contain the SQL script along with specific instructions for conversion.
