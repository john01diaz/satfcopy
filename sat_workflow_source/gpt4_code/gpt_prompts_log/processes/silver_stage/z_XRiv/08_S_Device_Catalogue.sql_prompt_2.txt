We need to convert Databricks SQL statements into vanilla python code. 
As a first stage we want to find the general patterns in the SQL statements so we can write the python code is a similar way.
To do this we will translate the Databricks SQL statements into pseudo code.

Where things are not clear please ask for a clarification

General instructions
Can you make the code as modular as possible.
Can you use clean coding principles.
Can you follow the PEP8 style guide.
Can you use human readable names.
Can you choose descriptive and unambiguous names.
Can you choose pronounceable names
Can you choose searchable names
Can you NEVER choose any abbreviations or shortened variable names
Can you replace magic numbers with named constants.

Can you define any literals as named constants
Define and name all lists and arrays separately

Specific instructions

Can you treat  the input files as pandas dataframes and read them in as parameters at the start,
Can you treat the dataframes as immutable - in other words, don't update them.

The input columns can be treated in different ways - modularise these different ways if possible.
sometimes a column will be passed through without any modification.
sometimes a columnn will be simply mapped to a column with a new name - note that the same column may be mapped several times
sometimes a new columnn will be added with a constant value
sometimes a columnn will be mapped to a column using  more complex calculations 

Can you make sure you complete all the lists and arrays - don't stop in the middle.

Code all literals as constants

Code all column names as constants - can you respect the case used in the SQL - in other words, use exactly the same case.
Can you prefix all the constant column names with the name of the table in which they come from.
Where a column name in a table is used with different cases, can you firstly advise us and secondly use the case of the first occurence.


use the names 'dataframe' and 'pandas' and .numpy' in full, do not abbreviate. 
give variables meaningful names

Here's the Python (Pandas) equivalent for your Databricks SQL Statement:

import pandas
import numpy

# Constants
CONSTANT_TRUE = "TRUE"

DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION = "RHLDD"

# Column names constants for S_Itemfunction (VDV)
VDV_DATABASE_NAME = "database_name"
VDV_DEVICE_TYPE = "Device_Type"

    # Filtering
    filtered_s_itemfunction = dataframe_s_itemfunction[dataframe_s_itemfunction[VDV_DEVICE_TYPE].isin(DEVICE_TYPES) & dataframe_s_itemfunction['location_designation'].notna()]
    filtered_s_item_function_model = dataframe_s_item_function_model[(dataframe_s_item_function_model[VM_LEFT].fillna(0) + dataframe_s_item_function_model[VM_RIGHT].fillna(0)) > MINIMUM_SUM_THRESHOLD]

    # Merging
    merged_dataframe = pandas.merge(filtered_s_itemfunction, filtered_s_item_function_model, how='inner', 
        on=[VDV_DATABASE_NAME, VDV_ITEM_DYNAMIC_CLASS, VDV_ITEM_OBJECT_IDENTIFIER, VDV_DYNAMIC_CLASS, VDV_OBJECT_IDENTIFIER])

    # Renaming
    merged_dataframe = merged_dataframe.rename(columns={VDV_DEVICE_TYPE: "Type", 
                                                        VDV_ITEM_OBJECT_IDENTIFIER: "Item_Object_Identifier",

    # Generating new columns
    merged_dataframe['AllowUse'] = CONSTANT_TRUE

    # Replacing suffix in database_name
    merged_dataframe[VDV_DATABASE_NAME] = merged_dataframe[VDV_DATABASE_NAME].str.replace(DATABASE_NAME_SUFFIX, '')

In this revised code, I've added the table name as prefix for each column name constant for clear indication of their origin. Also, I have updated the merging and renaming section of the code to use these new constant names.
